This was the final project of my course of Algorithms and Data Structures during my University Studies in Computer Science at Genoa.

You can find the assignment prompt PDF called "Laboratorio_Individuale_2023", essentially it was about building a DataBase regarding films and people who worked on them with the most efficent structure possible.
The hardest task is the one about finding the Bacon Number.

In "Relazione Laboratorio Individuale" you can find the description of the project and the complexity analysis, everything in Italian.

This project obtained maxium score ( 4/4 ).
